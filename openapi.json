    "description" : "\nThe Pixop API provides a comprehensive RESTful interface for interacting with the Pixop Platform.\nIt allows users to manage API keys, projects, videos, and more.\n\nThe Pixop Platform offers video processing features such as upscaling, format conversion, and compression. It uses\nAI-driven algorithms to optimize video quality, reduce file sizes, and improve playback performance.\n\n**Quick Start Guide**\n- Explore the [Pixop API Documentation](https://docs.pixop.com/reference/) to familiarize yourself with the API's capabilities.\n\n**Required Headers**\nInclude the following headers in all API requests:\n- `Accept`: `application/json`\n- `Content-Type`: `application/json`\n- `X-API-Key`: Your API key for authentication (e.g., `X-API-Key: <your-api-key>`).  \n  **Note:** API key management endpoints that use Basic Authentication do not require the `X-API-Key` header.\n\n**Rate Limits**\nAll endpoints, except those related to API key management, enforce rate limits. Response headers provide the following rate limit details:\n- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests allowed per minute.\n- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.\n- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The number of seconds until the current rate limit window resets.\n",

Currently `SHA256withECDSA`.\n\n**Signature format:**\n\n```\n<timestamp>.<payloadJson>\n```\n\n- `<timestamp>` is taken from `X-Pixop-Timestamp`\n- `<payloadJson>` is the raw request body as sent by Pixop\n\nThis string is signed using ECDSA (`SHA256withECDSA`), and the result is base64-encoded.\n\n**Verifying the Signature:**\n\n1. Concatenate the timestamp and request body:\n   ```\n   timestamp + \".\" + rawRequestBody\n   ```\n2. Retrieve the public key using the `X-Pixop-Public-Key-Id`:\n   ```\n   [GET /v1/webhooks/public-keys/{id}](https://docs.pixop.com/reference/getWebhookPublicKeyById/)\n   ```\n3. Verify the signature using the specified algorithm and public key.\n4. Reject requests with timestamps older than an acceptable threshold (e.g., 5 minutes) to mitigate replay attacks.\n\n**Webhook requests have a 10-second timeout. Respond promptly and handle long-running logic asynchronously to avoid delivery failures.**\n\nAlthough public key retrieval is typically fast, it's strongly recommended to **cache** it to reduce latency and improve performance.\n\n**Key rotation:**\n\nPixop rotates webhook signing keys regularly. During rotation, two keys may be valid for a short grace period. Always verify the signature using the public key referenced by `X-Pixop-Public-Key-Id`.\n\n**Code example:**\n\nA public [Spring Boot example project](coming-soon) is available to demonstrate webhook signature verification.\n\n---\n\n### Webhook Retry Behavior\n\nPixop automatically retries failed webhook deliveries using an **exponential backoff strategy***. Retry behavior can be customized per webhook.\n\nA webhook delivery is considered failed if:\n\n- The response status code is not `2xx`\n- The request times out or encounters a network error\n- The `WebhookRateLimitPerSecond` threshold is exceeded and no permit is acquired within 5 seconds\n\nIf a `429 Too Many Requests` response includes a `Retry-After` header (or similar), Pixop honors it when scheduling the next retry attempt.\n\nRetries continue until the maximum retry window (`maxTotalRetryDelayMinutes`) is reached.\n\nDetailed delivery history — including status codes, response bodies, retry timing, and headers — is available via the [GET /v1/webhooks/events](https://docs.pixop.com/reference/getWebhookEvents/) endpoints.\n\nWebhook event history is retained for **10 days**, or **1 day** for test events.\n\n**Event Ordering and Context**\n\nWebhook events are dispatched **asynchronously** and independently. While Pixop makes a best-effort attempt to deliver events in the order they occur, **delivery order is not guaranteed**.\n\nFor instance, a `video_processing.done` event may arrive **before** the corresponding `video_processing.started` event for the same `videoId`. This can happen due to network retries, parallel processing, or delays in webhook delivery.\n\nTo correctly handle events:\n\n  - Treat each event as **self-contained**\n  - Use the `occurredAt` date and time to determine the actual sequence of events\n  - Design webhook receivers to be **idempotent** and resilient to out-of-order delivery\n\nFor additional context about a given event, query the related video resource using:\n  [GET /v1/videos/{videoId}](https://docs.pixop.com/reference/getVideoById/)\n"
